Hey! RLF-35 fans are crazy expensive! They are literally $50 per fan. 

Buy them used/surplus in EU from www.maranos-shop.de, or world-wide on AliExpress. 
That way, you can get them for about $12-15. Still expensive, but will hopefully last long enough to become a more economical option than cheap 5015s that needs to be replaced.
